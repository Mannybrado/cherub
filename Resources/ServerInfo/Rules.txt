[color=#ff0000]You must be 18 or older to play Sector Crescent.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]Sector Crescent is a roleplaying server. Try to immerse yourself into your character. This includes doing your job as a station or ship crew member and delegating tasks that are outside of that description, or striking out upon space as a Captain of your ship. This does not imply you’re forced to play the whole round; Sector Crescent is designed with pop-in-and-out gameplay in mind, where some players will come and go but their bank account remains persistent across server restarts.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]0.[/color] Be not an asshole.
	- As this is primarily a roleplaying server, you will undoubtedly come into situations where your character might have to be antagonistic, rude, or otherwise unpleasant to be around. Please ensure that this only applies to your character and not yourself. We're all here to have fun or something.


[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Rules are subject to staff interpretation.
	- Rule lawyers will be dropkicked into the sun.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] As a matter of definition, ERP is not banned since we do not have to meet WizDen guidelines.[/color].
        - You still don't have any privacy. If you subject any of the mins or ghosts to lengthy emotes about your slime penis, I will kill you.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Minutemen, New League Homeguard and other command, high-risk roles are held to higher standards.
        - These people are what makes the round go 'round, and are subject to more scrutiny than usual.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Try to roleplay your best.
	- For the love of God, try to use proper grammar and capitalization. Avoid common meme phrases. Be pleasant to roleplay with.

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Syndicate and Minutemen.
	- The Syndicate are subject to the Code of Conduct, while the Minutemen follow the New Crescent Maritime Law. Corrupt authority figures are to be expected, but make an effort to atleast not be a shitter.

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Homo/Trans/Whatever -phobia;
	- Not the place for it, basketweaver.
